        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a Web Developer Instructor at Coding Dojo I have been teaching the basic Web Fundamentals and Python/Flask courses.  I have built many website and applications as a result.  However May 2022 offered me the chance to be a backup instructor and allowed me the chance to learn or get better at the other stacks.  As I already know React and Express/Nodejs and if needed with a little brushing up of Mongo I could teach the JavaScript stack, I chose to up-skill with Java. Until this point I had tried many times to learn and understand Java but to no avail.  So since I had the month of May to up-skill and I chose Java I actually joined a fellow Instructors class as a students.</p>
        <p>For my Capstone Project I have chosen to rebuilt a website that I have built as a demo to show new Python students what they can build.  However I added a twist.  Not only am I going to build or rebuild that project but I am going to do it in different frameworks and languages.  Can I have a React Front End with a Django Back End?  I am sure as I go through the process of building the different combinations it will grow and evolve.</p>
        <p>I am also looking forward to seeing how each combination responds.  Not just how difficult was it to build or deploy (although that is a factor too), but does one front end load faster than another.  Or does one backend load faster than another?  I can't wait.
