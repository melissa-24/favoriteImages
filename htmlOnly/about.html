        <h1>The Idea</h1>
        <p>As stated on the home page the idea is to build 1 website but do so with different frameworks and languages.  The combinations are farm from  limitless and as I build this page I have already added more to the original list and I am sure that it might continue to grow.</p>
        <p>Part of the other reason is to see not just the different ways that each framework and language is written but also how when all deployed through the same type of hosting account how they each behave.  Do they all load the same way?  Does 1 version have less code than others?  Does one language load faster than another one?</p>
        <h1>The Specifics</h1>
        <p>What languages will I use, what frameworks?  That is what this part is about.  </p>

                <h1>The Breakdown</h1>
                <p>In the department that I work for we teach a total of 5 stacks...the last being the Capstone part.  Every student in our program starts with Web Fundamentals, and then they have the choice of 1, 2, or 3 of the other stacks we teach MERN, Python, and Java.  Each of these 3 stacks are Full Stacks meaning the have both a front end and a back end. Where Web Fundamentals is front end only</p>
                <h3>Here is a rough breakdown of what we teach in each stack</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Fundamentals:
                        <ol>
                            <li>HTML - Got to start here</li>
                            <li>CSS - Styling it up</li>
                            <li>JS - Adding functionality to the site</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Python:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Python Fundamentals</li>
                            <li>MySQL - The current database structure we teach</li>
                            <li>Flask - The Framework</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>MERN:
                        <ol>
                            <li>JS Fundamentals</li>
                            <li>React</li>
                            <li>Express/Node</li>
                            <li>MongoDB</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Java:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Java Fundamentals</li>
                            <li>Spring</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                <h1>The Combos</h1>
                <p>As the idea behind this is to create the site in the different languages and frameworks I wanted to take it a little further and make some combos as well.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML base - This will well this site here but it will have links to the other versions as well as some of the same features.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Nasa API - with out the ability to save the image as there is no backend</li>
                            <li>The Looney Tunes API - again with out the ability to save the image as there is no backend</li>
                            <li>The Data - Each back end will have the ability to return the database data through an API and will be shown here</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pug base - This will be similar to the HTML base site to a point
                        <ul>
                            <li>This will use Node/Express as a way to display the pug files however like the HTML base will have no physical backend</li>
                            <li>It will have all the same features that the HTML base such as the Nasa API & Looney Tunes API</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Original Favorite Images App - This is the original version that I built for my python classes and has 1 extra feature that is currently not on the others just to keep the combinations simpler</li>
                    <li>Django Only - This will be build using the Django framework which uses Python and be self contained meaning it is all built with in the framework.
                        <ul>
                            <li>This based off of how we teach this at Coding Dojo (or rather as we have moved to Flask)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Flask Only - This will be using the Flask framework which also uses Python and like the Django Only version is self contained
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is based off of how it is currently taught at Coding Dojo</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Java Only - This will be created using Spring Boot which is Java based
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is based off of how it is currently taught at Coding Dojo</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>MERN - This is a React front end with a MongoDB back end (JavaScript)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Like Flask and Java this is also based off of how it is currently taught at Coding Dojo</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pug / Express - This will be a pug front end with Node Express backend</li>
                    <li>React / Django - A React front end talking to a Django backend</li>
                    <li>React / Flask - React front end talking to a Django backend</li>
                    <li>React / Express - React front end talking to a Node Express backend</li>
                    <li>React / Java - React front end talking to a Java backend</li>
                    <li>HTML / ??? - HTML front end and unsure what backend (possibly like react and have a version for all backends.</li>
