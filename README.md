# Favorite Images Project
This project is based off of an application that I built during one of my python classes.
- The idea is to take the application and create it in all the stacks that are taught in the PT Accelerated program at Coding Dojo and a combination of them as well. There are also a few extras thrown in as well.

## Application breakdown
1. [Flask Only](flaskOnly/notes.md) - This will be a full stack flask application
2. [Django Only](djangoOnly/notes.md) - This will be a full stack django application
3. [Java Only](javaOnly/notes.md) - This will be a full stack Java application
4. [React/Django](reactDjango/notes.md) - React front end with a Django backend
5. [React/Flask](reactFlask/notes.md) - React front end with a Flask backend
6. [React/Express](reactExpress/notes.md) - React front end with a Express Node backend
7. [React/Mongo](reactMongo/notes.md) - React front end with a Mongo backend
8. [Pug/Express](pugExpress/notes..md) - Pug front end with Express backend
9. [Front end Only](notes.md) - Base HTML/JS site - Main Deployed landing

# Python environment packages:
- I used a basic pip environment for both the django and flask parts to the requirements file has all the packages needed for both
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

# Node packages:
