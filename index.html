        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a Web Developer Instructor at Coding Dojo I have been teaching the basic Web Fundamentals and Python/Flask courses.  I have built many website and applications as a result.  However May 2022 offered me the chance to be a backup instructor and allowed me the chance to learn or get better at the other stacks.  Since I already know React and Express/Node I just need to brush up on them and better understand Mongo and I could be ready to teach the MERN stack.  However Java is the language chosen to learn. As our students progress through our program their last unit is where they essentially build a Capstone project.  So as I was being given the chance to be a student again I chose to also create one.</p>
        <p>My Capstone or challenge is to build the same project ut in each of the stacks.  So I chose a project that was quite fun to build when I was teaching Python/Flask.  This site will be the final results.... linking all the different versions that I build together.  I am excited to see how it turns out.</p>
